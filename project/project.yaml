# Example of the project template usage.
#
# In this example, a project is created, along with some of the
# resources that an enterprise is likely to need for regular operations.
#
# Note that the `parent_type` property defaults to "organization", so it
# does not need to be specified in the config. It is specified here for
# informational purposes. Allowed values are 'organization' or 'folder'
#
# See `templates/project.py.schema` for detailed information on the
# properties.
#
# Replace the `parent_id` placeholder with your organization ID/folder ID.
# Replace the `billing_account_id` placeholder with your billing
# account ID.
